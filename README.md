## Hands-on workshop at AIoT Devfest January 2020

In this workshop we will teach an Arduino board to recognize gestures! We will capture motion data from the [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble) board<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>, import it into TensorFlow to train a model, and deploy a classifier onto the board using [TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview). 

The hardware for this workshop has been provided by [Arduino](https://arduino.cc)
